<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

## Project Overview
This is a React application built with Vite, TypeScript, and SASS (SCSS). The project is called "AlgUI" and is a front-end only application.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: SASS/SCSS
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all components and utilities
- Use SCSS for styling (not plain CSS)
- Follow React functional component patterns with hooks
- Use proper TypeScript typing for props and state
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Use modern ES6+ syntax

## File Structure Conventions
- Components should be placed in `src/components/`
- Styles should use `.scss` extension
- TypeScript interfaces should be defined in separate files or at the top of component files
- Utility functions should be placed in `src/utils/`

## Development Notes
- This is a front-end only application - no backend integration
- Focus on modern, clean UI/UX design
- Use Vite's hot module replacement for fast development
